# Command-line flags

Generals accepts Polyworld's shared command-line flags, with Generals'
half-second simulation ticks. Existing Generals equals-form flags remain
supported.

Play against one BASIC opponent:

```sh
./out/generals --player --bot examples/scout.bas --seed 7
```

Control the tenth seat against nine BASIC opponents:

```sh
./out/generals --player:10 --bot:examples/scout.bas:9 --seed 7
```

Watch four BASIC bots, initially paused:

```sh
./out/generals --bot examples/scout.bas:4 --play=false --speed 4
```

Record a headless match and watch its replay:

```sh
./out/generals --headless --bot examples/scout.bas:4 --seed 7 \
  --ticks 4000 --record out/match.replay
./out/generals --replay out/match.replay
```

## Players and bots

`--player` controls seat 1. `--player:N`, `--player=N`, and `--player N`
select another one-based seat. Only one human is allowed, and a human
requires the graphical client. Input, fog, chat, and the outcome screen
follow that seat.

`--bot PATH[:COUNT]` and `--bot:PATH[:COUNT]` add BASIC bot groups. Repeat
the flag to combine policies. Bots fill seats in order, skipping the human.
Without `--players` or an engine config, the roster size is inferred from
the number of bots plus the human, and must be between 2 and 10. An explicit
roster must have exactly one supplied bot per nonhuman seat.

Bot groups without `--player` start an all-bot spectator match with the
whole board visible. Starting normally without bot groups keeps the local
human-versus-native-bots game. `--player:10 --players 10` also works with
native opponents.

The existing `--bot=SEAT:PATH` form assigns one BASIC policy to a specific
seat and leaves other seats using their existing native or human control.
Use either grouped bots or per-seat CLI assignments in one invocation.
A human seat cannot also have a bot. Grouped CLI bots replace config bot
assignments while keeping supplied names and MMR values.

## Shared flags

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--replay PATH` | Play a recorded action tape, or verify it when headless. |
| `--record PATH` | Save the live match as a Polyworld action tape. |
| `--seed N` | Seed the generated map. |
| `--ticks N` | Maximum simulation ticks, from 1 through 100000. |
| `--seconds N` | Set the limit to `N × 2` ticks. |
| `--minutes N` | Set the limit to `N × 120` ticks. |
| `--play true\|false` | Start graphical simulation or replay playing or paused. |
| `--speed N` | Initial graphical speed: 1, 2, 4, or 16. |
| `--windowSize WxH` | Set the native window dimensions. |
| `--vsync on\|off` | Enable or disable display synchronization. |
| `--headless-tick-rate N` | Pace headless simulation or playback at N ticks per second; 0 is unlimited. |
| `--llm-mode async\|barrier` | Shared scheduling selection. Both are equivalent for the current synchronous BASIC policies. |

Split and equals forms are accepted, including `--seed=7`,
`--replay=out/match.replay`, and `--play=false`. Polyworld's compact
`--windowSize:800x400`, `--vsync:off`, `--headless-tick-rate:24`, and
`--llm-mode:barrier` forms also work. Later duration flags replace earlier
ones. Pacing never changes simulation ticks or recorded actions.

Replays start at tick zero, playing and looping by default. `--play=false`
changes the initial playing state; `--at N` chooses another starting tick.
Replay playback cannot be combined with bot controllers, a human player,
or recording.

## Generals extensions

`--start` skips the menu. The older bare `--play` remains an alias for
`--start`; `--play false` has the standard Polyworld pause meaning.
`--turns N` aliases `--ticks N`, and `--size WxH` aliases `--windowSize WxH`.

The existing `--config`, `--players`, `--name`, `--mmr`, `--player-info`,
`--assets`, `--screenshot`, and `--at` flags accept split and equals forms.
See [BASIC settings](BOTS.md), [maps](MAPS.md), and [replays](REPLAYS.md) for
their contracts. `--help` lists all supported flags.
